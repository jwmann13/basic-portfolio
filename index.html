        <p>
                Hi! I'm Jeff! I'm 24 years old. I live in Sandy Springs, GA. I have a brother and a sister. I have a Bachelors of Music in Music Theory and a Certificate of Music Business from the University of Georgia. I love music and keep a deep appreciation of the artform. I often try to expand my listening pool and my favorite tools to find music are Spotify, RateYourMusic, and YouTube. I also like record stores and have a decently sized vinyl collection.
